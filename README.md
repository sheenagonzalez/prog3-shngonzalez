## Location-based Message Board
#### This is a mid-semester project for CS160: User Interface Design and Development course.

The task is to create a mobile application that functions as a location-based message board. 
In terms of features and functionality, the app is based on landmarks around the UC Berkeley campus. 
The user can see how far away the landmark is to their current location using distance calculation. 
Then, they can click on each landmark to view reviews of other users. They can also leave their own 
comments as long as they are within the target distance of the landmark.

The project is written in Java using Android Studio and Google's Firebase API, and finished within 
a week. Most of the code that I wrote can be found in the following folder path: 
prog3-shngonzalez/app/src/main/java/com/example/cs160_sp18/prog3/
